## Fraud Detection Project

This repository contains a data analysis project on fraud detection using a financial transaction dataset. The project focuses on building a fraud detection model and presenting the findings through data visualization.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze financial transaction data and develop a fraud detection model. The dataset contains information about various transactions, including transaction type, amount, old balance, and new balance. The main objective is to classify transactions as "Fraud" or "No Fraud" based on their features.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Project Highlights

1. Data Cleaning: Loaded the dataset and performed data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

2. Data Visualization: Visualized the distribution of transaction types using Seaborn's countplot to gain insights into the data.

3. Data Preprocessing: Mapped transaction types and fraud status to categorical labels for better analysis.

4. Model Building: Used a Decision Tree Classifier to train the fraud detection model.

5. Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, achieved an impressive accuracy score of 99.97% on the test set.

6. Prediction Function: Developed a function to predict fraud status for new transactions based on specified features.

### Usage

To replicate the analysis and run the prediction function on new data, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

2. Download the "fraud.csv" dataset provided in the repository.

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to go through the analysis process step by step.

4. Utilize the prediction function to classify new transactions as "Fraud" or "No Fraud" based on specified features.

### Conclusion

This project showcases the process of building a fraud detection model using Python and machine learning techniques. The high accuracy of the model demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions. Through this project, I have enhanced my data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming skills.
